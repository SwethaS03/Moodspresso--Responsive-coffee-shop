                Moodspresso offers a unique coffee house environment unlike any other. We are not only a place to drop in and get your morning 
                cup of coffee (although you are more than welcome to do that), we are a place where you can sit down and enjoy that tailor-made 
                cup of coffee. If you need to work, we have a seating area created specifically for you. If you need to rest, we have a soft-seating 
                area in front of a stone fire place that is perfect for your weary mind and body. We offer a delicious variety of coffee from Safehouse 
                Coffee made by our professionally trained baristas. We have everything from classic coffee to our house made specialty beverages.
                All of our sauces & syrups are made in-house with all natural ingredients (no chemicals or preservatives) ensuring you the highest 
                quality in taste & health.  You can complete your coffee with one of our delicious sweet treats made by our very own baker.  It 
                also provides a business hub where professionals in all industries can come to grab some coffee, hold a meeting, meet for lunch 
                or put in a full day of work. Our experienced baristas, professional support staff and convenient location lends an energetic 
                atmosphere to your day-to-day business needs. And not only can you work, print, scan and meet in a comfortable environment — 
                we also offer IT, business development and marketing assistance.                                It’s just a moment in time – 
                just one hand reaching over the counter to present a cup to another outstretched hand.
                But it’s a connection....
                We make sure everything we do honors that connection – from our commitment to the highest quality coffee in the world, to the 
                way we engage with our customers and communities to do business responsibly.
                From our beginnings as a single store over forty years ago, in every place that we’ve been, and every place that we touch, we've 
                tried to make it a little better than we found it.</p>

                <h2 class="section-header">Our Heritage</h2><br>
                Every day, we go to work hoping to do two things: share great coffee with our friends and help make the world a little better.
                 It was true when the first Moodspresso opened in 1971, and it’s just as true today.              A year later, in 1983, Howard 
                 travelled to Italy and became captivated by Italian coffee bars and the romance of the coffee experience. He had a vision to bring 
                 the Italian coffeehouse tradition back to the United States. A place for conversation and a sense of community. A third place between 
                 work and home. He left Moodspresso for a short period of time to start his own Il Giornale coffeehouses and returned in August 1987 
                 to purchase Moodspresso with the help of local investors.
                From the beginning, Moodspresso set out to be a different kind of company. One that not only celebrated coffee and the rich tradition, 
                but that also brought a feeling of connection.
                Our mission to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup and one neighbourhood at a time.
                Today, with store in more than 75 markets, Moodspresso is the premier roaster and retailer of speciality coffee in the world. And 
                with every cup, we strive to bring both our heritage and an exceptional experience to life.Coffeehouses continue the tradition set 
                by coffeehouses of the past. They still remain to be a very popular venue for people who would want relaxed and calm atmospheres where 
                they can talk, read, catch up on the day's event, meet with people and have excellent quality coffee.Historians have explained that the 
                coffeehouses in the UK grew in popularity during the 17th and 18th century. They became “public social places where people would meet 
                for conversation and commerce whilst drinking coffee”. Judging from what we all talk about while enjoying a cappuccino at Starbucks, 
                there is not a whole lot of difference between 1754 and 2016!
                Coffee was initially used for medicinal purposes before being introduced as a leisure drink. The first English “coffeehouse” was 
                introduced in 1650, the city of choice was Oxford and the man with the plan was Jewish entrepreneur Jacob Evelyn. The city of Oxford 
                was ideal for such an establishment and he called the shop “Angel”. A University city with plenty of aspiring poets, writers and scholars, 
                the coffeehouse became a popular location for debates.</p>

                To say Moodspresso purchases and roasts high-quality whole bean coffees is very true. That’s the 
                essence of what we do – but it hardly tells the whole story.
                Our coffeehouses have become a beacon for coffee lovers everywhere. Why do they insist on Moodspresso? 
                Because they know they can count on genuine service, an inviting atmosphere and a superb cup of expertly 
                roasted and richly brewed coffee every time.
                Expect More Than Coffee.
                We are passionate purveyors of coffee and everything else that goes with a rewarding coffeehouse experience.
                We also offer a selection of premium Tazo teas, fine pastries and other delectable treats to please the taste 
                buds. And the music you hear in store is chosen for its artistry and appeal. People come to Moodspresso to chat,
                meet up or work.
                We’re a neighborhood gathering place, a part of the daily routine – and we couldn’t be happier about it. Get to 
                know us and you’ll see: we are so much more than what we brew.Part of the reason coffee houses became so popular 
                were because they promoted sobriety. Many people (wisely) primarily drank little beers or weak ale at taverns at 
                the time, because water was rarely potable. Boiling water for coffee (and tea), however, killed bacteria and didn’t result in a mildly intoxicated public.
                Coffee houses were much more conducive to conducting business, and quickly became known as centers of commerce. Taverns became known as 
                rowdy places for drinking and gambling, but coffee houses were respectable establishments where men conducted their daily affairs. 
                For a single penny, a man could gain admittance to a coffee shop and stay as long as he like — there wasn’t an obligation to purchase 
                anything. Soon, coffee shops were known as “penny universities.”
                Notably, women weren’t permitted in coffee shops, unless they owned or worked in them. Even a respectable lady might stop at a 
                tavern if she needed to, for they were required by law to serve food and provide lodging. Coffee houses, which didn’t have these 
                legal requirements, weren’t a place for even an unrespectable woman, though. Some women took exception to this custom and published a petition, “The Womens Petition Against Coffee,” which was mostly tongue-in-cheek but does provide this lively description: “….the Excessive use of that Newfangled, Abominable, Heathenish Liquor called COFFEE.”</p>
